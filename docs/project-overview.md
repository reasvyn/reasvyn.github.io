# Project Overview: reasvyn.github.io

## 1. Introduction

`reasvyn.github.io` is a modern, high-performance personal portfolio and technical blog platform. It serves as a professional showcase for **Andreas Novyanto (Reas Vyn)**, a Fullstack Web Developer.

The project is uniquely designed with a **Terminal UI (TUI)** aesthetic, combining the nostalgic feel of a command-line interface with modern web performance and responsiveness.

## 2. Vision & Goals

- **Professional Identity:** A centralized hub for professional experience, projects, and contact info.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** A localized technical blog for sharing insights on web development.
- **TUI Aesthetic:** Delivering a "hacker-style" user experience through a Terminal-inspired interface.
- **Performance Excellence:** Near-perfect Lighthouse scores through Astro's Islands Architecture and self-hosted assets.
- **Global Reach:** Native multi-language support (English and Indonesian).

## 3. Key Features

- **Terminal UI (TUI):** A cohesive design language inspired by retro terminals, featuring boxy borders, monospaced typography, and functional windows.
- **Command Palette (Ctrl+K):** Instant navigation and command execution via a Svelte-powered modal.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Power-user shortcuts (e.g., `T` for theme, `G+H` for home, `G+B` for blog).
- **Localized Blog:** Full i18n support, draft mode, reading time calculation, and automated Table of Contents (ToC).
- **Dynamic Portfolio:** Sections for Skills, Tools, Showcase, and professional Career Timeline.
- **SEO & Social:** Automatic JSON-LD (Person/BlogPosting), Open Graph, and Twitter metadata.
- **Responsive TUI:** Mobile-first design including a specialized TUI-style mobile navigation menu.

## 5. Architecture Summary

The project follows a **Layered Architecture**:

1.  **Core Layer (`src/core/`):** Framework-agnostic kernel (Translator, Config, SEO, Env).
2.  **Content Layer (`src/content/`):** Astro Content Collections for blog posts.
3.  **Data Layer (`src/data/`):** Centralized JSON sources for skills, experience, and projects.
4.  **Component Layer (`src/components/`):**
    - `ui/`: Atomic UI elements and Svelte components.
    - `partials/`: Molecular TUI windows and section layouts.
5.  **Routing Layer (`src/pages/`):** i18n-aware file-based routing.
